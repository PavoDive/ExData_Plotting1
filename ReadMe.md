# Folder Structure and Contents
This repo has the files required by the Project 1 of Exploratory Data Analysis, **as well as** the original files in the repo (forked) of RdPeng.

## Folder contents
### Original Repo
The files pertainging to the original repo are
* RdPeng-README.md --> original read me file of the repo
* figures (folder) --> folder containing the guides of figures that need to be produced

### Actual Project
The files produced during the project are:
* ReadMe.md --> this file
* Plot\[1-4\].R --> script files for producing the required plots. \[1-4\] refers to "plot1.R", "plot2.R", etc.
* Plot\[1-4\].png --> image files with the required plots. Naming convention follows the pattern described above.

## R scripts, Images and Nature of the Data
The project aimed at evaluating the student's capacity to produce exploratory plots of provided data. Therefore, aestethics or relevance/meaning aren't to be evaluated at this point.

The data is a simplified version of "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set", wich is a dataset on the the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. It has minute-to-minute data on electric consumption (kW) in three sub circuits of a house, together with relevant data on total active and reactive power, voltage and amperage. Original file and information could be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption).

Each R script is coded to produce (without data) the corresponding plot. Overall the structure is download data --> cleaning --> producing exploratory plots.
